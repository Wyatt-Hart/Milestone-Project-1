# Milestone-Project-1

This game was inspired by basic 2D fighting games like Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter.

CONTROLS:
LeftArrow and RightArrow move Left and Right
UpArrow is jump
DownArrow is a block
"1" is attack

How To Play:
Once the start button is pressed, a 3 second countdown begins and then the opponent immediately begins to move towards
the player to attack. Block will reduce damage, and discourage the enemy from attacking. By jumping in the air and pressing
the attack button, you can do a jump attack. First player to bring their opponents health to zero wins. To play again you
have to refresh the browser.

This program only uses vanilla JavaScript, and has a lot of custom variables and functions in place to determine collision detection, player/enemy direction, and AI behavior.
There currently is still a bug where on a rare occasion the enemy will not flip when the player jumps over them, causing them to run off screen, and occasionally
the death animation for the player does not play completely when the player is defeated.
